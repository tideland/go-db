// Package redis provides a very powerful as well as convenient client
// for the Redis database.
//
// After opening the database with Open() a pooled connection can be
// retrieved using db.Connection(). It has be returnded to the pool with
// with conn.Return(), optimally done using a defer after retrieving. The
// connection provides a conn.Do() method to execute any command. It returns
// a result set with helpers to access the returned values and convert
// them into Go types. For typical returnings there are conn.DoXxx() methods.
//
// All conn.Do() methods work atomically and are able to run all commands
// except subscriptions. Also the execution of scripts is possible that
// way. Additionally the execution of commands can be pipelined. The
// pipeline can be retrieved db.Pipeline(). It provides a ppl.Do()
// method for the execution of individual commands. Their results can
// be collected with ppl.Collect(), which returns a sice of result sets
// containing the responses of the commands.
//
// Due to the nature of the subscription the client provides an own
// type which can be retrieved with db.Subscription(). Here channels,
// in the sense of the Redis Pub/Sub, can be subscribed or unsubscribed.
// Published values can be retrieved with sub.Pop(). If the subscription
// is not needed anymore it can be closed using sub.Close().
